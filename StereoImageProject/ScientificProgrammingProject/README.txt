Lucas Dubouchet Project
Needs the OpenCV API

How to use:
Drag and drop an image on the .exe file
In the first menu, select a filter (Gaussian or median) and an Anaglyph method (the other buttons)
Close the GUI window
After that, left-click on the top left corner of your left image, then on the bottom right corner of your left image, then on the top left corner of your right image to create your frames
Close the Image window
After that, you can right-click or left-click to move the red image and adapt your result (Still Work In Progress though)
